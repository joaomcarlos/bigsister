**## BigSister, will baby sit your bots for you.**

**## Current features:**
- No injection what so ever. All "smart" options are out-of-process.
- Autorun (startup with windows)
- Multi Accounts
- Multi Bnet accounts inside each account
- Alias
- Smart Character selection (actually reads games memory)
- Queue Detection
- Multi Server Selection Support (not fully implemented, almost there)
- Botting Profiles (basically you can have profiles set up with any diferent types of botting schemes, and you can save them seperately)
- "Telemetry" so you can actually read what each bot is doing (and so it can smartly react to problems)
- CPU and Memory readings for WoW and Bot.
- Will query the Tripwire page to find out if its safe to bot, if not, kills all bots and stops relogging.
- Will detect if your connection goes down and relog accordingly.
- Keyboard emulation so that it can relog without taking control of the keyboard or mouse.
- Rearange Windows Function, renames and repositions your WoW windows in a panel like style.
- Always on top - keep your bot panel on top so you can see whats going on.

**## Planned Features:**
- Bot schedules, allowing you to place your characters on "cooldown", for example, bot from 2am to 6am.
- Schedule swapping, basically you can tell it to swap character X with character Y from (example) 6am to 12am.
- Remote control (monitor the relogger and bots using MSN, so you can use cellphone-webmessenger-default messenger).
- Extra features by using HB plugin to have more control over HB (still to find out what stuff I can implement)
- Workout for you, so you can lose weight while you bot. Wouldnt it be great if there was a program to workout for you the same way HB/GB levels/farms for you?

**## Dev Notes:**
- BigSister must be run as administrator or similar (Windows empata-fodas thingy off... or allow relogger to use it)
- BigSister must be able to access the internet.
- In order for BigSister to read the bots window in realtime, it must **NOT be minimized to tray**.
- Beta software, report all problems with appropriate information, stuff like, what did you exactly do for the problem to show up, stuff like "oh, i clicked start and it crashed" will be ignored.
- During beta phase, I will limit the period the program will work, I choose to do this to force people to update their software as to report accurate and still un-fixed bugs.
